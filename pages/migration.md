## Food Crisis

W. W. Hunter who looked at the record of the famine nearly a century later, wrote, *“the peasants sold their cattle; they sold their implements of agriculture, they devoured their seed grain, they sold their sons and daughters, till at length no buyer of children could be found, they ate the leaves of trees and the grass of the field and in June 1770, the resident at the Darbar affirmed that the living were feeding on the dead."*

In 1769 Bengal faced a famine whose ravages two generations failed to repair. Lower Bengal has three harvests each year: scanty pulse crop in spring; rice crop in autumn; and December, the harvest of the year. In 1768, the scarcity of rainfall failed the next cycle of irrigation. Though there is a high price of food, the scarcity had not been so severe as materially to affect the Government rental. The land tax has been rigorously enforced. In September 1769, the rain prematurely ceased. 

In the 18th century, the aristocracy of Bengal Nawabs and Zamindars were all gone. East India Company came into power. Dadni system was abolished affecting the artisans to limestone workers, blacksmiths, and boatmakers. Dadni businessman paid the artisans an advance to produce various kinds of products, selling the product was not the artisans’ concern. But the company only emphasized silk. Muhammad Reza Khan was Nawab dewan of Bengal during the famine of 1770. The local Nawabs and Zamindars could stop the famine because they had enough grains in their storage. Even they looted from the farmers. Reza often raided Rungpur grain market and took all the rice and grain forcefully to his storage. During this time of famine, Reza’s sepoys used to stop the grain merchants’s boats and forcefully bought the grain.

Huge amounts of rice, and grains were transported by Reza from Dinajpur, Rungpur to Murshidabad, Dhaka. Raja Shitae Roy joined in this catastrophe and controlled every shipment of rice and grain from Rungpur to Patna. They failed to save Murshidabad and Patna because most of the grain was lotted to feed the British Garrison. So, it created the food crisis. In 1770, food grain was transported from Dinajpur, Murshidabad to Fort William, Calcutta. Then from Calcutta to St. George, Madras, then Madras to Fort Marlborough, Sumatra.

The native superintendent of Bishenpore wrote, *“The fields of rice are become like fields of dried straw."*

## Affected Areas

1770 famine occurred during the administration of Cartier, governor of Fort William in Bengal. Some portions of former western and northern Bengal have now been included within the Eastern Pakisthan, devastated western and northern Bengal and Bihar. Mr. William Harwood, Supervisor of Rajmahal and Bhagalpur, wrote on 23rd April, 1770, 
*“As a proof of this (severity of famine) I need only mention the number of souls who have perished thro’ want to Boglepoor town, within the last five months (i.e. from December 1769 to April 1770), which upon a strict enquiry I find to exceed one-third of the inhabitants.”*

It appears from the account that the Supervisor of Purnia received from Parganahs, that nearly two lakhs of people perished in his district. The crops were damaged by flood because the river Koshi changed its course every year. Then sands were deposited in paddy fields. Bishnupur district in Bengal suffered the worst along with Purnia due to famine. Before the outbreak, there were 265 families in the 11 villages of the Maner Parganah in Rajashani district. Out of 265 families, only 127 families survived at the end of 1771. There was a reduction of 51 ½  % of the families. In the fifteen villages of the Arwal parganah, there were 291 families before the famine, but at the end of the year 1771 only 157 families survived. Thus there was a reduction of about 46 percent of the families in fifteen villages of the Arwal Parganah. Allumgunj, once a great rice market town, had so much declined that a great part of the town was full of jungles and literally a refuge.

## Migration

Detailed maps of Bengal, Bihar and Bangladesh, illustrating the districts ravaged by the famine, identified food crisis areas,  and patterns of people’s migration. Users can explore the extent of the devastation and understand the geographical spread of the crisis. 
People moved from Western Bengal to  Eastern Bengal. Bihar lost a portion of its population by desertion as some people of western Bihar migrated to Benaras. Some of the people migrated to Nepal from Purnea because of the state was less confiscatory than the East India Company. In Birbhum, four years before the famine, it was recorded that there were 6,000 rural communities each with a village in the centre of its lands. In 1771, three years after the famine, only 4,000 of these communities survived.
