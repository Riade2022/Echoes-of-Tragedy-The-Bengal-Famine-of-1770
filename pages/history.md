## History of Famine

Chiẏāttôrer mônnôntôr or The Great Bengal Famine of 1770 was a devastating event that struck Bengal and Bihar between 1769 and 1770, affecting approximately 30 million people. The bengali name “Chiẏāttôrer mônnôntôr” is derived from Bengali calender year 1176 and the Bengali word meaning famine. During this period, Bengal was under dual governance: the East India Company had been granted the diwani (the right to collect revenue) by the Mughal emperor in Delhi, but the control of civil administration, or nizamat, remained with the Mughal governor, the Nawab of Bengal Nazm ud Daula. 

The famine was triggered by crop failure in the autumn 1768 and summer 1769, exacerbated by an accompanying smallpox epidemic. The East India Company had farmed out tax collection due to a shortage of trained administrators, which may have worsened the famine’s impact. Grain merchants ceased offering grain advances to peasants, but the market mechanism for exporting the merchants’ grain to other regions remained in place. The company purchased a large portion of rice for its army, and the Company’s private servants and their Indian Gomasthas created local monopolies of grain. By the end of 1769, rice prices had risen two-fold, and in 1770 they rose a further three-fold. The continual passage of armies in the already drought-stricken countryside worsened conditions in Bihar.
