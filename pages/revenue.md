## The Government Reaction to the Famine : Increasing Revenue Demand Despite the Economic Collapse


This section contains an in-depth analysis of the roles played by the East India Company, local zamindars, and the colonial administration in exacerbating the famine, highlighting the systemic failures that prolonged the suffering of the populace. The exhibit examines how the Company’s revenue soared during this period, despite the widespread suffering. A critical aspect of the digital exhibit is the juxtaposition of the Bengal Famine with the economic interests of the East India Company. By analyzing historical data and records, the website elucidates how the Company's revenue increased amidst the famine, underscoring the perverse incentives that prioritized profit over humanitarian concerns.

In 1769-70, out of 30 million people, 5 in every 16 were officially admitted to have perished, and only pound 9000 were expanded on relief by the government. In a year when 35 percent of the whole population and 50 percent of the cultivators perished, even not 5 percent of the land tax was remitted, 10 percent was added to it for the ensuing year. The Company issued orders prohibiting the export of grain from one district to another except to the city of Murshidabad. Similar orders were issued to the authorities at Chittagong and they were asked not to export grain anywhere except to Calcutta.

## Net Revenue of Birbhum District

While famine carried off 25% of the district population, the revenue demand of the company increased by 54% in 1776 over the amount of 1769.  In 1769, the year of drought and total failure of crops, the settlement of Birbhum district was made for 7,25,000, which was about double the amount collected amount of Rs. 3,66,509 in 1728. Next year, the year of famine, the amount rose to Rs. 7,68,400. In 1771, when the devastations were reported to be “beyond description dreadful," the revenue demand further increased and amounted to Rs. 8,11,879“, about twelve thousand more than that of 1765.
