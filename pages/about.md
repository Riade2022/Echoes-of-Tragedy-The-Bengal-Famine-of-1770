## About the Project

“Echoes of Tragedy: The Bengal Famine of 1770” is a digital exhibit that delves into one of the most catastrophic events in Indian history. This exhibit aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the famine through a collection of photographs, paintings, lithographs, maps, graphic narratives, and scholarly articles, shedding light on the affected areas, the socio-economic conditions, and the aftermath of the famine. This digital platform provides an immersive experience, allowing visitors to navigate through various sections that feature interactive timelines, maps, and thematic galleries. Each segment is designed to provide a deeper understanding of the famine’s causes, the human cost, and how colonization impacted Indian history.

## The Metadata and Userbase


The expected users of this collection are students, as well as individuals who are interested in visual art and photography. For this reason, the location metadata indicates the originating institution of each digital artifact. This collection would also appeal to researchers who were interested in topics relating to famine. This allows for easier discovery and research. I invite scholars, students, and the general public to engage with this poignant chapter of history. “Echoes of Tragedy” is not just a remembrance of the past but a call to reflect on the complexities of governance, the resilience of communities, and the imperative of humanitarian action in times of crisis.

I use Collection Builder Website, and its back end on Github is available to the public. On both, the data itself, and metadata are available. As a result of using Collection Builder, an open-source collection tool, all of the code responsible for building the website is available to the public.
